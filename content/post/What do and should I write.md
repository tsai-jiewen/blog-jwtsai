{{% callout note %}} 
Q: I am a student/researcher, so my writing will usually publish in a journal. So my question is, WHAT things are suitable to post on the Internet? 
{{% /callout %}}


## 1. Methods part: Pure tech notes (for learning)
- R codes, procedure.
- But it does not touch the core of the study.

A tech note includes:
- {{< hl >}}Callout: target task.{{< /hl >}}
- Intro essential concepts. (a paragraph)
- 1-5 steps to solve. (list)
 


## 2. Idea part: Review for a topic 
- When we read books and papers, we will keep some notes (index cards), and it may be possible to develop some kind of framework that helps people understand well. This kind of paper is good for beginners but has not touched some frontier issues yet, so sharing on the net is not bad.

A review includes:
- {{< hl >}}Callout: target papers. (1-5) {{< /hl >}}
- Highlights. (a paragraph)
- 1-5 points. (list)
